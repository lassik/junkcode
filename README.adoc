Junkcode
========

This is my personal junkcode repository. It contains assorted bits of
code that are not polished or useful enough to publish as full-blown
projects, but that I save for my own use and for reference.

If you want to re-use some of this code, feel free to email me and
I'll send you a copy under any permissive license of your choice. I
live in Europe so I can't just put things into the public domain :-(
