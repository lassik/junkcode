Junkcode
========

This is my personal junkcode repository. It contains assorted bits of
code that are not polished or useful enough to publish as full-blown
projects, but that I save for my own use and for reference.

If you want to re-use some of this code, just ask and I'll send you a
copy under any permissive license of your choice. I live in Europe so
I cannot place things into the public domain.
